# SoundCloud HLS Downloader

A super simple Python ~~command-line tool~~ TUI for downloading audio tracks from SoundCloud using HLS (HTTP Live Streaming) protocol. This tool supports both regular and GO+ tracks when provided with appropriate authentication tokens.

## Features

- Download any accessible content in different formats
- Full support for both regular and GO+ premium tracks
- Token-based authentication
- Multiple audio codec options
- Customizable output file naming
- Audio files actually have cover art as of v2.1.3

> __NOTE:__ `.ogg` files (__Opus__ and __Vorbis__) aren't fully compatible with cover art. You would need to install a Shell extension like `Icaros` or `K-Lite` to render those thumbnails in File Explorer.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x or newer
- FFmpeg installed and available in your system PATH
- Required Python packages:
  - `requests`, `textual`, `rich`

## Installation

### Quick Setup

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/RalkeyOfficial/soundcloud-downloader.git
   cd soundcloud-downloader
   ```

2. Install the required Python package:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Install FFmpeg:
   - **Windows**:
     - Using winget (recommended): `winget install ffmpeg`
     - Using chocolatey: `choco install ffmpeg`
     - Alternatively: Download from [FFmpeg official website](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) and add to PATH
   - **macOS**: `brew install ffmpeg`
   - **Linux**: `sudo apt-get install ffmpeg` or equivalent for your distribution

### Verifying Installation

Verify FFmpeg is correctly installed:
```bash
ffmpeg -version
```

## Configuration

There are two ways to provide the required authentication tokens:

### 1. Using a Configuration File (Recommended)

Create a `config.json` file in the same directory as the script:

```json
{
	"client_id": "YOUR_CLIENT_ID",
	"oauth": "YOUR_OAUTH_TOKEN" // optional
}
```

### 2. Using Command Line Arguments

Provide tokens directly when running the script (see Usage section below).

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```bash
# With config.json in place
python soundcloud_downloader.py
```

### Advanced Usage (CLI)

Note: currently doesn't do anything as the CLI is still to be made

```bash
python soundcloud_downloader.py \
    --url "https://soundcloud.com/artist/track-name" \
    --output "song_name" \
    --codec "vorbis" \
    --client_id YOUR_CLIENT_ID \
    --oauth YOUR_OAUTH_TOKEN
```

### Command Line Arguments

| Argument | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `--url` | (Required) SoundCloud track URL | None |
| `--output` | Output filename (excluding extension) | output |
| `--codec` | Audio codec (mp3, opus, vorbis, aac, flac, wav) | mp3 |
| `--config` | Path to configuration JSON file | config.json |
| `--client_id` | SoundCloud client ID | From config |
| `--oauth` | SoundCloud OAuth token | From config |

The SoundCloud OAuth token is only required for GO+ tracks, and can be entirely omitted for other tracks.
A OAuth token looks like this:
```
// obviously not a real token
OAuth 1-234567-123456789-aBcD1234eFgHIj
```

### Codec Quality Notes

- **MP3**: 192 Kbps (higher bitrate, standard compatibility)
- **Opus**: 96 Kbps (excellent quality, lower compatibility)
- **Vorbis**: 96 Kbps (excellent quality, lower compatibility)
- **AAC**: 192 Kbps (Not recommended unless you need it)
- **Flac**: Compression level: 8 (Not recommended unless you need it)
- **Wav**: 16-bit PCM (Not recommended unless you need it)

Opus and Vorbis codecs provide similar perceived quality to MP3 at half the bitrate, resulting in smaller file sizes.

## Troubleshooting

The script will exit with appropriate error messages if:

- FFmpeg is not installed or not found in PATH
- Required tokens are missing
- Track URL cannot be resolved
- HLS stream is not available for the track
- Download process fails

## Important Notes

- This tool **requires** valid SoundCloud authentication tokens
- For GO+ tracks, you need tokens from a GO+ subscription account
- No guarantee is provided regarding account safety - use at your own risk
